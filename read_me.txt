This is the official submission of Team Lone Amber for NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024 - Project STFU
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Code files "detect_moon.py" and "detect_mars.py" perform the processing and plot the starts and ends of seismic events as detected compared to the STA/LTA method provided by the challenge data packet.
- Code files "detect_moon_output.py" and "detect_mars_output.py" performs analysis of dataset defined inside these two code files, then export a .csv result file.
- Folder "detection_results" contains analyzed results for all datasets provided in the official data packet.
- Folder "space_apps_2024_seismic_detection" contains the data provided by the challenge, plus new and modified catalog files made by the team. To avoid errors, please DO NOT tamper with this folder.

Thank you for an amazing hackathon and your time judging this project!
